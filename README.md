# HANGMAN-GAME
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where players guess letters to uncover a hidden word, represented by underscores. Each correct guess reveals the letter, while incorrect guesses build a stick figure drawing. This Tkinter-based version offers a GUI, immediate feedback on guesses, and a new game option.
